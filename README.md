My personal projects

Project Ideas:
==============

Learn about:
* Red + Black Trees (never learned in data structures)
* Test-driven development

Do some more Project Euler and actually put my solutions here instead of
deleting them

* Text-based adventure [Key topics: basic i/o, basic code structure]
* Conway's Game of Life [Key topics: cellular automata, arrays, mouse input, simple rendering]
* Tetris [Key topics: basic collisions, keyboard input, slightly less simple rendering]
* Snake [Key topics: linked lists]
* Asteroids [Key topics: trigonometry, slightly less basic collisions]
* Minesweeper [Key topics: flood fill]
